What Makes a Password Strong?
1. Length:
Aim for passwords that are at least 16 characters long. Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack
2. Complexity:
Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid predictable patterns like "1234" or "password". 
3. Unpredictability:
Avoid using personal information such as names, birthdays, or common words. Instead, create random combinations or use unrelated words.
4. Uniqueness:
Use a different password for each of your accounts to prevent a single breach from compromising multiple services.
5. Memorability:
Consider using a passphrase—a sequence of random words—that's easy to remember but hard to guess. For example: "HorsePurpleHatRunBayLifting". 
🧪 Test Your Password Strength
Before using a new password, it's wise to test its strength. Here are some reputable tools:
Bitwarden Password Strength Tester: Evaluates password strength and offers a secure password generator. 
Security.org Password Checker: Analyzes your password against a database of common weak passwords. 
Kaspersky Password Checker: Checks your password's resistance to hacking attempts and offers suggestions for improvement. 
Delinea Password Strength Checker: Provides an assessment of your password's robustness.
These tools process your password locally in your browser, ensuring that your data isn't transmitted or stored.
🧠 Tips for Creating and Managing Strong Passwords
Use a Password Manager: Tools like Bitwarden or NordPass can generate, store, and autofill complex passwords, reducing the burden of remembering each one. 
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security can protect your accounts even if your password is compromised.
Regularly Update Passwords: Change your passwords periodically, especially if you suspect any breach.
Avoid Reusing Passwords: Each account should have a unique password to prevent a domino effect in case of a breach.
